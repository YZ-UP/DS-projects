# Project Overview 
This project "Is Kiva Creating Efficient Impact Through Microlending?" was presented in the UPenn 2023 Spring Data Science Live Program.
# What is this Project about? 
Using multiple Kiva microlending datasets on Kaggle and country development indexes such as UN indexes and gender equality indexes, we explored whether the loan amounts that Kiva gives to developing countries are associated with countries' level of development -- Is Kiva giving the most loans to countries that most need them? 
# Findings 
Lots of loans go to helping small local businesses, and we indeed found that employment rate is a strong predictor of the loan amount. Other common country development indexes, such as GDP per capital, CO2 emissions, populations using improved sanitation facilities, are negatively associated with the loan amount, indicating that Kiva is helping countries with smaller-scale economy. 
However, we also observed that internet coverage is a strong positive predictor, indicating that Kiva heavily relies on internet to find and help recipients. Thus, we proposed that Kiva should expand its services to areas with less internet connection to help those without access to online microlending.
